This is a movie app using next.js, Typescript and Scss. I tried creating some components from scratch imitating some youtube components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## RoadMap

- adding the authentication

- display he loggin button accordingly if logged in or not

- add loggout button

- add functionality to vote for a movie iff logged in and send the data from that vote

- add filters buttons logic (Need a filter on the different genres, filter by popularity, vote average, Release date (oldest, most recent),)

- add search filter.
