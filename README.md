This is a movie app using next.js, Typescript and Scss. I tried creating some components from scratch imitating some youtube components.

## RoadMap

- add functionality to vote for a movie if logged in and send the data from that vote

- add comments section to a movie 

- add filters buttons logic to similar movies

- redo the fetch on the pagination based on the scroll, check how it wirks with server side rendering

- fix the searchbar (some styles got buggued and need to work on the redirection).

- add account page to check movies the user voted on and other functionalities
